# echo

This is an iOS application that acts like a virtual sound mixer that plays what is heard on the microphone and loops it to the playback device. It was initially created so that I could help my grandmother who is hard of hearing by using bone conduction headphones. The app would playback everything in clear audio. The initial story to realizing I should do something like this was when I got my own pair of bone conduction headphones because a friend had them and they sounded really nice. I wondered if it would work on my grandmother. I put them on my grandmother and called my uncle and aunt, and when I asked if she could hear them, she could, but it would be terrible quality due to poor audio bitrate of phone calls. This inspired me to create an application on the iPad which was her main device. I'm sure there are already applications in the App Store that do the job if not better, however it was a great opportunity to learn and get familiar with xcode and swift.
